This repository hosts algorithms and data structures written in the Rust programming language.

The following algorithms are available:
  - Sorting:
    - Bubble sort
	- Insertion sort
	- Quicksort
	- Mergesort
	- Radix sort
  - String search
  
Other algorithms are work in progress and will be added progressively.
